# THE STORY OF SIGURD


(This is a very old story: the Danes who used to fight with the English
in King Alfred’s time knew this story. They have carved on the rocks
pictures of some of the things that happen in the tale, and those
carvings may still be seen. Because it is so old and so beautiful the
story is told here again, but it has a sad ending—indeed it is all sad,
and all about fighting and killing, as might be expected from the
Danes.)

Once upon a time there was a King in the North who had won many wars,
but now he was old. Yet he took a new wife, and then another Prince,
who wanted to have married her, came up against him with a great army.
The old King went out and fought bravely, but at last his sword broke,
and he was wounded and his men fled. But in the night, when the battle
was over, his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain,
and at last she found him, and asked whether he might be healed. But he
said ‘No,’ his luck was gone, his sword was broken, and he must die.
And he told her that she would have a son, and that son would be a
great warrior, and would avenge him on the other King, his enemy. And
he bade her keep the broken pieces of the sword, to make a new sword
for his son, and that blade should be called Gram.

Then he died. And his wife called her maid to her and said, ‘Let us
change clothes, and you shall be called by my name, and I by yours,
lest the enemy finds us.’

So this was done, and they hid in a wood, but there some strangers met
them and carried them off in a ship to Denmark. And when they were
brought before the King, he thought the maid looked like a Queen, and
the Queen like a maid. So he asked the Queen, ‘How do you know in the
dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning?’

And she said:

‘I know because, when I was younger, I used to have to rise and light
the fires, and still I waken at the same time.’

‘A strange Queen to light the fires,’ thought the King.

Then he asked the Queen, who was dressed like a maid, ‘How do you know
in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing near the dawn?’

‘My father gave me a gold ring,’ said she, ‘and always, ere the
dawning, it grows cold on my finger.’

‘A rich house where the maids wore gold,’ said the King. ‘Truly you are
no maid, but a King’s daughter.’

So he treated her royally, and as time went on she had a son called
Sigurd, a beautiful boy and very strong. He had a tutor to be with him,
and once the tutor bade him go to the King and ask for a horse.

‘Choose a horse for yourself,’ said the King; and Sigurd went to the
wood, and there he met an old man with a white beard, and said, ‘Come!
help me in horse-choosing.’

Then the old man said, ‘Drive all the horses into the river, and choose
the one that swims across.’

So Sigurd drove them, and only one swam across. Sigurd chose him: his
name was Grani, and he came of Sleipnir’s breed, and was the best horse
in the world. For Sleipnir was the horse of Odin, the God of the North,
and was as swift as the wind.

But a day or two later his tutor said to Sigurd, ‘There is a great
treasure of gold hidden not far from here, and it would become you to
win it.’

But Sigurd answered, ‘I have heard stories of that treasure, and I know
that the dragon Fafnir guards it, and he is so huge and wicked that no
man dares to go near him.’

‘He is no bigger than other dragons,’ said the tutor, ‘and if you were
as brave as your father you would not fear him.’

‘I am no coward,’ says Sigurd; ‘why do you want me to fight with this
dragon?’

Then his tutor, whose name was Regin, told him that all this great
hoard of red gold had once belonged to his own father. And his father
had three sons—the first was Fafnir, the Dragon; the next was Otter,
who could put on the shape of an otter when he liked; and the next was
himself, Regin, and he was a great smith and maker of swords.

Now there was at that time a dwarf called Andvari, who lived in a pool
beneath a waterfall, and there he had hidden a great hoard of gold. And
one day Otter had been fishing there, and had killed a salmon and eaten
it, and was sleeping, like an otter, on a stone. Then someone came by,
and threw a stone at the otter and killed it, and flayed off the skin,
and took it to the house of Otter’s father. Then he knew his son was
dead, and to punish the person who had killed him he said he must have
the Otter’s skin filled with gold, and covered all over with red gold,
or it should go worse with him. Then the person who had killed Otter
went down and caught the Dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it
from him.

Only one ring was left, which the Dwarf wore, and even that was taken
from him.

Then the poor Dwarf was very angry, and he prayed that the gold might
never bring any but bad luck to all the men who might own it, for ever.

Then the otter skin was filled with gold and covered with gold, all but
one hair, and that was covered with the poor Dwarf’s last ring.

But it brought good luck to nobody. First Fafnir, the Dragon, killed
his own father, and then he went and wallowed on the gold, and would
let his brother have none, and no man dared go near it.

When Sigurd heard the story he said to Regin:

‘Make me a good sword that I may kill this Dragon.’

So Regin made a sword, and Sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of
iron, and the sword broke.

Another sword he made, and Sigurd broke that too.

Then Sigurd went to his mother, and asked for the broken pieces of his
father’s blade, and gave them to Regin. And he hammered and wrought
them into a new sword, so sharp that fire seemed to burn along its
edges.

Sigurd tried this blade on the lump of iron, and it did not break, but
split the iron in two. Then he threw a lock of wool into the river, and
when it floated down against the sword it was cut into two pieces. So
Sigurd said that sword would do. But before he went against the Dragon
he led an army to fight the men who had killed his father, and he slew
their King, and took all his wealth, and went home.

When he had been at home a few days, he rode out with Regin one morning
to the heath where the Dragon used to lie. Then he saw the track which
the Dragon made when he went to a cliff to drink, and the track was as
if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley.

Then Sigurd went down into that deep place, and dug many pits in it,
and in one of the pits he lay hidden with his sword drawn. There he
waited, and presently the earth began to shake with the weight of the
Dragon as he crawled to the water. And a cloud of venom flew before him
as he snorted and roared, so that it would have been death to stand
before him.

But Sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit, and then
he thrust the sword Gram right into his very heart.

Then the Dragon lashed with his tail till stones broke and trees
crashed about him.

Then he spoke, as he died, and said:

‘Whoever thou art that hast slain me this gold shall be thy ruin, and
the ruin of all who own it.’

Sigurd said:

‘I would touch none of it if by losing it I should never die. But all
men die, and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire. Die
thou, Fafnir,’ and then Fafnir died.

And after that Sigurd was called Fafnir’s Bane, and Dragonslayer.

Then Sigurd rode back, and met Regin, and Regin asked him to roast
Fafnir’s heart and let him taste of it.

So Sigurd put the heart of Fafnir on a stake, and roasted it. But it
chanced that he touched it with his finger, and it burned him. Then he
put his finger in his mouth, and so tasted the heart of Fafnir.

Then immediately he understood the language of birds, and he heard the
Woodpeckers say:

‘There is Sigurd roasting Fafnir’s heart for another, when he should
taste of it himself and learn all wisdom.’

The next bird said:

‘There lies Regin, ready to betray Sigurd, who trusts him.’

The third bird said:

‘Let him cut off Regin’s head, and keep all the gold to himself.’

The fourth bird said:

‘That let him do, and then ride over Hindfell, to the place where
Brynhild sleeps.’

When Sigurd heard all this, and how Regin was plotting to betray him,
he cut off Regin’s head with one blow of the sword Gram.

Then all the birds broke out singing:

‘We know a fair maid,
A fair maiden sleeping;
Sigurd, be not afraid,
Sigurd, win thou the maidv Fortune is keeping.

‘High over Hindfell
Red fire is flaming,
There doth the maiden dwell
She that should love thee well,
Meet for thy taming.

‘There must she sleep till thou
Comest for her waking
Rise up and ride, for now
Sure she will swear the vow
Fearless of breaking.’

Then Sigurd remembered how the story went that somewhere, far away,
there was a beautiful lady enchanted. She was under a spell, so that
she must always sleep in a castle surrounded by flaming fire; there she
must sleep for ever till there came a knight who would ride through the
fire and waken her. There he determined to go, but first he rode right
down the horrible trail of Fafnir. And Fafnir had lived in a cave with
iron doors, a cave dug deep down in the earth, and full of gold
bracelets, and crowns, and rings; and there, too, Sigurd found the Helm
of Dread, a golden helmet, and whoever wears it is invisible. All these
he piled on the back of the good horse Grani, and then he rode south to
Hindfell.

Now it was night, and on the crest of the hill Sigurd saw a red fire
blazing up into the sky, and within the flame a castle, and a banner on
the topmost tower. Then he set the horse Grani at the fire, and he
leaped through it lightly, as if it had been through the heather. So
Sigurd went within the castle door, and there he saw someone sleeping,
clad all in armour. Then he took the helmet off the head of the
sleeper, and behold, she was a most beautiful lady. And she wakened and
said, ‘Ah! is it Sigurd, Sigmund’s son, who has broken the curse, and
comes here to waken me at last?’

This curse came upon her when the thorn of the tree of sleep ran into
her hand long ago as a punishment because she had displeased Odin the
God. Long ago, too, she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear,
and dared not ride through the fence of flaming fire. For she was a
warrior maid herself, and went armed into the battle like a man. But
now she and Sigurd loved each other, and promised to be true to each
other, and he gave her a ring, and it was the last ring taken from the
dwarf Andvari. Then Sigurd rode away, and he came to the house of a
King who had a fair daughter. Her name was Gudrun, and her mother was a
witch. Now Gudrun fell in love with Sigurd, but he was always talking
of Brynhild, how beautiful she was and how dear. So one day Gudrun’s
witch mother put poppy and forgetful drugs in a magical cup, and bade
Sigurd drink to her health, and he drank, and instantly he forgot poor
Brynhild and he loved Gudrun, and they were married with great
rejoicings.

Now the witch, the mother of Gudrun, wanted her son Gunnar to marry
Brynhild, and she bade him ride out with Sigurd and go and woo her. So
forth they rode to her father’s house, for Brynhild had quite gone out
of Sigurd’s mind by reason of the witch’s wine, but she remembered him
and loved him still. Then Brynhild’s father told Gunnar that she would
marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted
tower, and thither they rode, and Gunnar set his horse at the flame,
but he would not face it. Then Gunnar tried Sigurd’s horse Grani, but
he would not move with Gunnar on his back. Then Gunnar remembered
witchcraft that his mother had taught him, and by his magic he made
Sigurd look exactly like himself, and he looked exactly like Gunnar.
Then Sigurd, in the shape of Gunnar and in his mail, mounted on Grani,
and Grani leaped the fence of fire, and Sigurd went in and found
Brynhild, but he did not remember her yet, because of the forgetful
medicine in the cup of the witch’s wine.

Now Brynhild had no help but to promise she would be his wife, the wife
of Gunnar as she supposed, for Sigurd wore Gunnar’s shape, and she had
sworn to wed whoever should ride the flames. And he gave her a ring,
and she gave him back the ring he had given her before in his own shape
as Sigurd, and it was the last ring of that poor dwarf Andvari. Then he
rode out again, and he and Gunnar changed shapes, and each was himself
again, and they went home to the witch Queen’s, and Sigurd gave the
dwarf’s ring to his wife, Gudrun. And Brynhild went to her father, and
said that a King had come called Gunnar, and had ridden the fire, and
she must marry him. ‘Yet I thought,’ she said, ‘that no man could have
done this deed but Sigurd, Fafnir’s bane, who was my true love. But he
has forgotten me, and my promise I must keep.’

So Gunnar and Brynhild were married, though it was not Gunnar but
Sigurd in Gunnar’s shape, that had ridden the fire.

And when the wedding was over and all the feast, then the magic of the
witch’s wine went out of Sigurd’s brain, and he remembered all. He
remembered how he had freed Brynhild from the spell, and how she was
his own true love, and how he had forgotten and had married another
woman, and won Brynhild to be the wife of another man.

But he was brave, and he spoke not a word of it to the others to make
them unhappy. Still he could not keep away the curse which was to come
on every one who owned the treasure of the dwarf Andvari, and his fatal
golden ring.

And the curse soon came upon all of them. For one day, when Brynhild
and Gudrun were bathing, Brynhild waded farthest out into the river,
and said she did that to show she was Gudrun’s superior. For her
husband, she said, had ridden through the flame when no other man dared
face it.

Then Gudrun was very angry, and said that it was Sigurd, not Gunnar,
who had ridden the flame, and had received from Brynhild that fatal
ring, the ring of the dwarf Andvari.

Then Brynhild saw the ring which Sigurd had given to Gudrun, and she
knew it and knew all, and she turned as pale as a dead woman, and went
home. All that evening she never spoke. Next day she told Gunnar, her
husband, that he was a coward and a liar, for he had never ridden the
flame, but had sent Sigurd to do it for him, and pretended that he had
done it himself. And she said he would never see her glad in his hall,
never drinking wine, never playing chess, never embroidering with the
golden thread, never speaking words of kindness. Then she rent all her
needlework asunder and wept aloud, so that everyone in the house heard
her. For her heart was broken, and her pride was broken in the same
hour. She had lost her true love, Sigurd, the slayer of Fafnir, and she
was married to a man who was a liar.

Then Sigurd came and tried to comfort her, but she would not listen,
and said she wished the sword stood fast in his heart.

‘Not long to wait,’ he said, ‘till the bitter sword stands fast in my
heart, and thou will not live long when I am dead. But, dear Brynhild,
live and be comforted, and love Gunnar thy husband, and I will give
thee all the gold, the treasure of the dragon Fafnir.’

Brynhild said:

‘It is too late.’

Then Sigurd was so grieved and his heart so swelled in his breast that
it burst the steel rings of his shirt of mail.

Sigurd went out and Brynhild determined to slay him. She mixed
serpent’s venom and wolf’s flesh, and gave them in one dish to her
husband’s younger brother, and when he had tasted them he was mad, and
he went into Sigurd’s chamber while he slept and pinned him to the bed
with a sword. But Sigurd woke, and caught the sword Gram into his hand,
and threw it at the man as he fled, and the sword cut him in twain.
Thus died Sigurd, Fafnir’s bane, whom no ten men could have slain in
fair fight. Then Gudrun wakened and saw him dead, and she moaned aloud,
and Brynhild heard her and laughed; but the kind horse Grani lay down
and died of very grief. And then Brynhild fell a-weeping till her heart
broke. So they attired Sigurd in all his golden armour, and built a
great pile of wood on board his ship, and at night laid on it the dead
Sigurd and the dead Brynhild, and the good horse, Grani, and set fire
to it, and launched the ship. And the wind bore it blazing out to sea,
flaming into the dark. So there were Sigurd and Brynhild burned
together, and the curse of the dwarf Andvari was fulfilled.[33]

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
